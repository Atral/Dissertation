Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to tbest ofologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation sys.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also tinreforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current populatios 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locondoor without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For goveinment and other organizations, they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due forunhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways dependforg on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where therare a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need fort only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, andtoravel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to haven environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they uin irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of theonime is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to mwithntain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water toforhe country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money froank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concdown on On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage ohe land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the lanto make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three soof factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries afor companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like tto appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most o lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw moneyofhe bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For government and other organizations, they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen.

As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For government and other organizations, they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint verificthink of reader combined with built-in smartcard reader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation stem to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The resulted in to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands,in most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and trel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

A good example is Japan where there are a lofromof tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environmentforan sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated.

Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the towardsnk without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the conditioof the inhabitable environment.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their mofbers to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the socToty for safety, convenience and economy.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more peoplinif they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provideforlean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's ssible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation stem.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal coonuters, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material thatlead to support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an eforironment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three socfactors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problfor the good ofountries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://eonwikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For government and other organizations, twho are on maternity leavemall size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This cauconsist ofblem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms theresults ino make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Nuclear technology had come a long way since Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917. The subsequent realization that the additional neutrons produced from fission reaction can induce a nuclear chain reaction sparked off widespread interest in nuclear technology. Since then, nuclear technology had been through wars, arms races and had found many applications in the medical, industrial and energy fields.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering passworinnd travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation systemput in counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shapedthroughy three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitablforland and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan wheas there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one fornd more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

The only way to satisfy the increasing demandthroughof space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irdecide onon to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human boinaracteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

When uranium fission was discovered in 1938, it sparked widespread scientific interest due to the massive amount of energy released by the reaction. However most American physicists were still skeptical that it could be turned into a bomb or an energy source. forwever, with the world on the brink of war, military considerations would accelerate the development of nuclear technology beyond the imagination of the initial skeptics. Following fears that Nazi Germany was developing nuclear weaponry, the Manhattan Project was initiated in the United States. The project eventually grew to include over thirty sites across America dedicated to nuclear research. The research effort culminated in "Fat Man" and "Little Boy", two atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima respectively. Although wartime nuclear research brought about nothing but devastation and death, President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech would set the world off on the road of peaceful pursuit of nuclear energy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more aboutd more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to cnter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some couofries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Identification has become more and more important in ourfromiety. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and tnology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain bytong technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakfor happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Binides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hafor, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric iforntification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live fheir citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008).

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livabland technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without intotering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also importawith to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to rof aforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from tInank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access perstol computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain theiinlives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys,ithdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good exame is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For examine, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

As the number of people grows, the ne of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts aon ad swamps.

Identification has become more and morportant in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For government and other organizations, they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard onader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

(RTI), which captures a retinal image at distances from the user's eye with the means of just using a patented aspheric lens array. Hence the RTI system is very inexpensively and can be commonly used (Retinal Technologies, Inc. Launches Company and Revolutionizes Biometrics With Patented Retinal Scanning Technology, 2001).

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space uase, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better materiwith that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as dessefors and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any naturalaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquesofbly essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For government and other organizations, they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and iriseof voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some atportant departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable antechnology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our currt population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having diffiwithlties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Moreover, the society is looking for economic ways of identification. Therefore, the equipments of biometric identification tend to be in-expensive. For instance, Retinal Technologies, Inc. (RTI), which captures a retinal image at distances from the user's eye with the means of just using a patented aspheric lens array. Htoce the RTI system is very inexpensively and can be commonly used (Retinal Technologies, Inc. Launches Company and Revolutionizes Biometrics With Patented Retinal Scanning Technology, 2001).

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Besides safety, convenience is also desirable for identifications. We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password, neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification. For government and other organizations, they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification. Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick, and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments. We can have fingerprint veritocation reader combined with built-in smartcard reader, and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a in depthr usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank withointo entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric da to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

Some countries are having difficulties in managingoflace to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer buildin a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigatiooverto bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The soluinon can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern. On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers, so the secret data and documents may be stolen. On the other hand, some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification. This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben, 2008). As we can see, the biometriidentification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability.

The effects of the use of biofric identification are obvious. With biometric identification, our fingers, faces and even eyes become our identification. This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefit to the government, the military, business and every individual.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the worlfromthout taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almt no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better macontributes to can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without kwiths, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despitforany natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. Forple, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Besides number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three socl factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water toscared ofountry. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadays, we can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the rld without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.

For example, countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the toabitable environment.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment. The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate mtonumber of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage, but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have. For example, countries with a lot of deserts c terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert. Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country. Another example is Netherlands, whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level, have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable.

As the number of people grows, the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential. In this era, Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accomdation by designing a stronger material so it's possible to create a taller and safer building, a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease, and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment.

Humans have many basic needs and one of them isforo have an environment that can sustain their lives. Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially. This will, if not already, caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us. The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps.

Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated. This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environmento The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces. It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes. A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there. Besides a better usage of lands, a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath. For example, countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system.

Identification has become more and more important in our society. Thanks to biometric identification, nowadaysin this  can open a locked door without keys, withdraw money from the bank without entering password, and travel around the world without taking various cards. Biometrics, by definition, refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns and hand measurements. Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification, this technology is also shaped by three social factors, namely, the desire of the society for safety, convenience and economy.
